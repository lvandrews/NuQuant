## Installation

### Installing NuGEN Assay on Qubit 2.0
(can only be implemented on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometers running firmware v3.11 (or higher). For instruments requiring an upgrade, see firmware upgrade instructions.)

  1.	Unplug Qubit
  2.	Insert the USB drive containing the new assay file(s) into the USB drive port of the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer.
  3.	Plug in Qubit
  4.	Select “Yes” when prompted to upload


### Installing NuGEN Assay on Qubit 3.0

  1. Insert the USB drive containing the new assay file(s) into the USB drive port of the Qubit® 3.0 Fluorometer. A small USB icon will    appear on the bottom left of the screen.
  2. Go to the Settings screen and touch Import new assay. The instrument searches the USB drive for assay file(s) and the Import new      assay screen displays the names of the assays found on the USB drive.
  3. Touch to “NuGENv0.3 Library Quant” to select. Touching the selected assay a second time deselects it.
  4. Select the destination folder for the new assay and touch Save. The Verification screen opens. Each folder can hold up to 9 assays.
  Alternatively, touch New folder to create a new destination folder.
  5. On the New folder screen, touch the New folder text field. A keyboard pops up. Using the keyboard, type in the name of the new destination folder. You can use up to 11 characters; spaces at the beginning or the end of the name are not recognized.
  6. Touch Enter, and then touch Done to return to the Import new assay – Where screen. The newly created folder will appear in the list of folders.
  7. Select the new destination folder and touch Save. The Verification screen opens.
  8.	On the Verification screen, touch Done to complete the import process.

### Uninstalling NuGEN Assay on Qubit 2.0

If you wish to remove the assay, including the NuGEN button from your Qubit home screen, perform the following steps:

  1.	Follow the steps for upgrading firmware (see firmware upgrade instructions.)
  2.	Once you press the “Update” button, a message will appear titled “Updating: Select Assay(s) to Delete”. Select “NuGEN”. The NuGEN line will turn gray, indicating it has been selected.
  3.	Click “OK”. 
  4.	Another window will appear with the message “The selected assay(s) will be deleted. Do you wish to proceed?”  Click “Yes”. 
  5.	The “Updating firmware…” status bar will appear. After approximately 1 minute, the update will be complete and the NuGEN app will have been removed.

### Uninstalling NuGEN Assay from Qubit 3.0

  1.	Go to the Settings screen and touch Manage assays.
  2.	Next to NuGEN assay, touch Delete, then Done.
  3.	The next screen will ask “This will permanently delete the selected assay(s). Do you wish to continue?" Touch "OK".

## Quantification of NuGEN libraries on Qubit 2.0 

  1.	Aliquot 195 uL RB1 into thin-wall, clear, 0.5-mL PCR tubes. Prepare one tube for each standard (S1 and S2), and one tube for each library.
  2.	Add 5 uL of standard or library to each tube containing RB1 from Step 1. Close lids securely, mix thoroughly by vortexing, and spin briefly to collect all liquid into the bottom of the tube.
  IMPORTANT:  Standards and libraries can settle over time. If standards and libraries are not thoroughly mixed, inaccurate results may occur.
  3.	Select “NuGEN” from the Qubit home screen.
  4.	Follow the on screen prompts to read S1, S2, and samples.
  Note: The Qubit 2.0 displays the “Assay Tube Concentration.” To calculate the stock concentration of each library, select the “Calculate Stock Conc.” button, and change the “Volume of Sample Used” to 5 uL. The correct stock concentration of your library will be displayed.
